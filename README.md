🕹️ Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — without using any external libraries or frameworks.
Both players take turns marking their symbol (X or O) on the 3x3 grid. The game automatically checks for winning combinations after every move and displays the winner.
If all boxes are filled and no winning pattern is matched, the game declares a Draw.

🙌 About the Project

I developed this project from scratch, typing every line of code myself to understand the logic and flow behind JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and game logic implementation.
